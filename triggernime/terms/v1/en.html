    <h2>4. Personal Boundaries and User Behavior</h2>

        The Bot is a software tool and does not control, supervise, or moderate
        user behavior beyond its technical functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
        All forms of interaction between users, including any actions in real life,
        are carried out independently, voluntarily, and by mutual consent of the users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Responsibility for respecting personal boundaries, safety measures,
        and compliance with the laws of the relevant jurisdiction
        rests entirely with the users.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User Responsibility</h2>

        <li>The user bears personal responsibility for their behavior and participation in the game.</li>
        <li>The user agrees to use the Bot in accordance with the laws of their country.</li>

        During the operation of the Bot, a minimally necessary set of data is processed
        in accordance with the <a href="https://fleishera.ru/triggernime/privacy/index.html#en">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The content of user messages is not stored as chat history
        and is used solely for processing commands and in-game interactions.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Media Files</h2>
    <p>
        If the user sends images, audio, voice messages, or videos:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>media files may be shared with other participants of the game session
            if this is provided by the game mechanics;</li>
        <li>media files are not used outside the scope of the relevant game session
            and are not applied for any other purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        The Bot is provided on an “as is” basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Bot administration does not guarantee that the service will meet user expectations,
        operate without interruptions, or be free of technical errors.
    </p>
    <p>
        The user independently decides on their participation in the game process
        and bears full responsibility for any actions taken in connection with the use of the Bot.
    </p>

    <p>The Bot administration is not responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>actions or decisions made by users;</li>
        <li>consequences of completing or refusing game challenges;</li>
        <li>subjective perception of the content by users;</li>
        <li>temporary technical failures of Telegram or third-party services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Paid Features and Digital Content</h2>
    <p>
        The Bot may provide access to additional game features
        and sets of digital content on a paid basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Payment grants the user the right to access digital content
        under the conditions specified in the description of the relevant feature at the time of purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the moment access to digital content is provided,
        the service is considered started and part of its cost is deemed used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Refunds are made solely in cases and in the manner
        provided for by applicable law and the rules of the payment services used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Short-term technical issues or temporary unavailability of certain features
        do not constitute grounds for an automatic refund.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Bonuses and Price Reduction</h2>
    <p>
        As part of using the Bot, users may be awarded bonuses
        for in-game actions, inviting other users,
        and/or their purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bonuses are an element of the game mechanics,
        are not monetary funds,
        cannot be exchanged for money,
        and do not have a fixed monetary value.
    </p>
    <p>
        The user may use available bonuses
        to reduce the cost of paid features or digital content of the Bot,
        if this is provided for by the relevant game mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application of bonuses is possible only in compliance with the restrictions
        established by the payment services used,
        including requirements for the minimum transaction amount.
    </p>
    <p>
        If full coverage of the cost of a paid feature by bonuses
        is not possible for technical or payment-related reasons,
        the user pays the remaining part of the cost with monetary funds.
    </p>
