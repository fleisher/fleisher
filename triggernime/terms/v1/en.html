<h1>User Agreement</h1>

<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
<p><strong>Telegram bot:</strong> <a href="https://t.me/triggernime_bot">@triggernime_bot</a></p>

<p>
    This User Agreement defines the terms and conditions for using the Telegram bot
    (hereinafter referred to as the “Bot”), which is intended for entertainment purposes.
    By using the Bot, the user confirms that they have read, understood, and fully accepted
    the terms of this Agreement.
</p>

<h2>1. Age restriction</h2>
<p>
    The Bot is intended for users aged 16 and older.
    By using the Bot, the user confirms that they have reached the specified age.
    If you are under 16 years old, please discontinue using the service.
</p>

<h2>2. Nature of the service and content</h2>
<p>
    The Bot is an interactive entertainment service designed to facilitate game sessions
    between users in the form of questions, tasks, and interaction scenarios.
</p>

<p>
    The content of the Bot is aimed at creating a game experience and may include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>questions and tasks that encourage communication between participants;</li>
    <li>game mechanics involving choice of actions, discussion, and reactions to answers;</li>
    <li>scenarios focused on group interaction, humor, and informal communication;</li>
    <li>elements of engagement and competition within the game process.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Tasks and questions provided by the Bot are of a playful nature and do not imply
    performing actions that require special training or that pose a risk to the life,
    health, or safety of users.
</p>

<h2>3. Voluntary participation</h2>
<p>
    Participation in game sessions within the Bot is entirely voluntary.
</p>
<p>
    The user may skip any question or task if it seems inappropriate or uncomfortable,
    and may stop using the Bot at any time without providing a reason.
</p>
<p>
    The content of the Bot is intended to promote positive interaction between participants.
    If a user experiences negative emotions, embarrassment, or believes that the content
    does not align with their personal, moral, or ethical views, they may stop participating
    in the game and discontinue using the Bot at any time.
</p>

<h2>4. Personal boundaries and user behavior</h2>
<p>
    The Bot is a software tool and does not exercise control, supervision, or moderation
    over user behavior beyond its own functionality.
</p>
<p>
    All decisions, actions, and forms of interaction between users, including any actions
    in real life, are carried out independently by the users, on a voluntary basis and by
    mutual consent.
</p>
<p>
    Responsibility for respecting personal boundaries, safety measures, and compliance
    with the laws of the relevant country rests entirely with the users themselves.
</p>

<h2>5. User responsibility</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The user bears personal responsibility for their behavior and participation in the game process.</li>
    <li>The user agrees to use the Bot in compliance with the laws of their country.</li>
    <li>If any content appears unacceptable to the user, they should discontinue using the service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Data processing</h2>
<p>
    In order to operate, the Bot processes a minimal set of data, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>the user’s Telegram User ID;</li>
    <li>the displayed username, if provided;</li>
    <li>technical data related to the game session.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The content of messages sent by users is <strong>not stored</strong> as chat history
    and is used solely for processing commands and in-game interactions.
</p>

<h2>7. Media files</h2>
<p>If the user sends images, audio, voice messages, or videos:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the Bot may forward them to other participants of a game room if required by the game mechanics;</li>
    <li>media files are not used outside the scope of the relevant game session.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Disclaimer and limitation of liability</h2>
<p>
    The Bot is provided on an “as is” basis and is used by users at their own discretion.
</p>
<p>
    Tasks, questions, and other elements of the Bot’s content are of an informational
    and entertainment nature, are not mandatory to perform, and do not imply coercion
    into any actions.
</p>
<p>
    The user independently decides whether to participate in the game and whether to
    perform or refrain from performing any proposed tasks, and bears full responsibility
    for any actions taken in connection with the use of the Bot.
</p>
<p>The administration of the Bot shall not be liable for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>actions or decisions made by users while using the Bot;</li>
    <li>consequences of performing or not performing game tasks;</li>
    <li>subjective perception of the game content by users;</li>
    <li>temporary technical failures in the operation of Telegram or third-party services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Paid features and subscriptions</h2>
<p>
    The Bot may provide access to additional game features or content packs on a paid basis,
    including access for a specified period of time (such as a week, a month, or other terms).
</p>
<p>
    Upon payment, the user receives access to the relevant game content under the conditions
    described at the time of purchase.
</p>
<p>
    The cost of paid access to the Bot’s game features and content represents a fee for
    providing access to digital content and is not a daily or monthly usage fee.
</p>
<p>
    From the moment paid access is activated, a portion of its cost is considered used,
    and the cost of access is distributed unevenly over the duration of the access period.
</p>
<p>
    In the event that the user stops using the Bot or access is terminated early, any refund,
    if required by applicable law, shall be calculated taking into account the used portion
    of the access.
</p>
<p>
    Refunds are processed in cases and in the manner предусмотренных by applicable law
    and the rules of the payment service providers used.
</p>
<p>
    Short-term technical interruptions, service downtime, or temporary unavailability of
    certain features for technical reasons do not constitute non-performance of the service
    and do not automatically entitle the user to a refund.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of prolonged unavailability of the Bot due to technical reasons, the
    administration may, at its discretion, provide an extension of access or another form
    of compensation.
</p>

<h2>10. Acceptance of the agreement</h2>

<ul>
    <li>have read this User Agreement;</li>
    <li>understand and accept its terms;</li>
    <li>are at least 16 years old.</li>
</ul>

    the Bot.
